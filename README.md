# Mapping_Earthquakes
Plot Data on mapbox map through an API request .

## Project Plan
### Purpose
The main  purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

### Tasks
To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

### Approach
Our  approach will be to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. we Will further  use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

## Deliverable 1 
You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 1 by completing all requirements below:

The tectonic plate data is added as a second layer group (10 pt)
The tectonic plate data is added to the overlay object (10 pt)
The d3.json() callback is working and does the following: (10 pt)
The tectonic plate data is passed to the geoJSON() layer
The geoJSON() layer adds color and width to the tectonic plate lines
The tectonic layer group variable is added to the map
The earthquake data and tectonic plate data displayed on the map when the page loads (5 pt)
